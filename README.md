## This is an example of using a model.js file with and app.js to create a webpage.


Our objectives for this particular webpage were to:

Use jquery for the set up of each webpage

Use a header/ navigation bar and a footer that would appear on each page exactly the same.

Come up with original content to practice mixing jquery with previous knowledge.

Use a model file to better organize the jquery used inside the website.

I made these webpages by first downloading the jquery to my library, and then I made the basic outline for each page. Then, I created the model.js file, and began moving my content over to that file. Then, I tied the model file to the app file. Finally, I created the stylesheets I used for styling the elements of each page.
